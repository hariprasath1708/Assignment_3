About the Datasets

1. Parkinson’s Disease Dataset

Source:The dataset contains vocal measurements from individuals, including both healthy participants and those with Parkinson’s disease.

Features: Vocal fundamental frequencies (MDVP:Fo, MDVP:Fhi, MDVP:Flo) Signal measures like jitter, shimmer, and HNR (Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio) Dynamical features such as RPDE, DFA, and pitch period entropy (PPE) Objective: To classify whether an individual is positive or negative for Parkinson’s disease.

2. Liver Disease Dataset Source: This dataset includes clinical and laboratory data of individuals, focusing on liver health. Features:

Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin Alkaline Phosphatase, Alanine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase Total Proteins, Albumin, and Albumin-Globulin ratio Objective: To predict the presence or absence of liver disease.

3. Kidney Disease Dataset

A medical dataset containing data on kidney function indicators. Features:

Age, blood pressure (BP), specific gravity (SG), albumin (AL), sugar levels Counts for red and white blood cells, serum creatinine, and sodium levels Appetite status and coronary artery disease presence Objective: To identify individuals at risk for chronic kidney disease.

About the Models

Parkinson’s Disease Model

Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier Preprocessing: Feature scaling using a StandardScaler. Training: Model trained on balanced data to optimize prediction accuracy. Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy and F1-score, making it suitable for reliable predictions.

Liver Disease Model Algorithm: Logistic Regression (or another appropriate model depending on the implementation). Preprocessing: Scaled the features using a StandardScaler for consistent input representation. Training: Tuned for sensitivity and specificity to handle imbalanced datasets.

Kidney Disease Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier Preprocessing: Similar scaling applied for numerical stability. Training: Model fine-tuned for early-stage kidney disease detection with high precision.

Why These Models?

XGBoost: Ideal for structured datasets with its ability to handle missing data and boost prediction accuracy.

Logistic Regression: Effective for binary classification tasks with interpretable coefficients.

Random Forest: Robust against overfitting and excellent for handling non-linear relationships.
